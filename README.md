# Hibernate

Hibernate is a widely used open-source object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for Java.
It provides a framework for mapping Java objects to database tables and vice versa, allowing developers to work with Java objects rather than SQL statements when interacting with databases.
Hibernate simplifies database programming in Java by handling the details of database interactions, making it easier to create, retrieve, update, and delete data.
